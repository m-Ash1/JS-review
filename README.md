# Revision of Basic JS Concepts

This JavaScript script serves as a revision tool for some basic JavaScript concepts that are commonly used in React. The script covers the following topics:

- Destructuring Objects and Arrays
- Rest/Spread Operator
- Template Literals
- Ternaries Instead of if/else Statements
- Arrow Functions
- Short-Circuiting and Logical Operators: `&&`, `||`, `??`
- Optional Chaining
- The Array `map` Method
- The Array `filter` Method
- The Array `reduce` Method
- The Array `sort` Method
- Working with Immutable Arrays
- Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises
- Synchronous JavaScript: Async/Await

By reading this script, you can gain a better understanding of these fundamental concepts that underlie JavaScript development, which will help you to write more effective and efficient React code.

The code is designed to be easy to read and understand. Each topic is covered in a separate sections, with comments explaining the content of the section and how it uses the concept being revised.

To run the script inside VS Code, I recommend using the [Quokka.js extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode). This extension allows you to run your JavaScript code and see the results directly in the editor, making it easier to test and debug your code.

I also recommend using the [Better Comments extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) to illustrate comments in a better way. This extension provides different styles of comments that can help you to highlight important information and improve the readability of your code.

You can use this script as a reference or practice tool to reinforce your understanding of these basic JavaScript concepts. Whether you are new to JavaScript or need a refresher, this script can help you to improve your skills and become a more confident and effective React developer.
